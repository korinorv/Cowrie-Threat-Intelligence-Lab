# Cowrie-Threat-Intelligence-Lab
A deep-dive threat analysis of automated SSH botnet behaviour. This repository documents the deployment of a Cowrie medium-interaction honeypot in the EU-West region, capturing 5,800+ attack vectors, analysing a 3-phase post-exploitation lifecycle, and identifying Mirai/Gafgyt malware variants captured over a 24-hour window.
